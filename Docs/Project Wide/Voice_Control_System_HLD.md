## Design Philosophy

The Voice Control System is architected with a focus on flexibility, efficiency, and user-centric design. This system
aims to provide a seamless and intuitive interface for voice-based interaction with various applications and services,
catering to both technical and non-technical users. Key principles guiding this design include:

- **Modularity:** Each component of the system, such as voice recognition, command processing, and user interface, is
  designed as a separate module. This modular approach ensures ease of maintenance, scalability, and the potential for
  future enhancements.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system prioritizes a user-friendly experience, making it accessible to a broad range
  of users with varying levels of technical expertise. This includes clear and intuitive UI design, straightforward
  command creation processes, and comprehensive help resources.

- **Scalability and Adaptability:** The architecture is built to be scalable, easily accommodating additions and
  modifications. It is adaptable to different user environments and requirements, ensuring longevity and relevance in
  diverse usage scenarios.

- **Integration and Flexibility:** While the system primarily operates locally, it's designed to be flexible in terms of
  integration with other technologies and services. For this porpuse a tag system is incorporated that allows the user
  to define commands accesible based on the environment, from different modes, different focused application and
  potentially much more.

- **Performance and Efficiency:** The system is optimized for high performance and efficiency, ensuring swift processing
  of voice commands and dictation, even in resource-constrained environments.

- **Customizability:** A key feature of the system is its high degree of customizability. Users can tailor the system to
  their specific needs, from setting preferences to creating custom commands and scripts.

This design philosophy underpins the development of a system that is not only technologically robust but also aligns
with the needs and expectations of its users.

## System Architecture Overview

The Voice Control System is structured around a modular and event-driven architecture, ensuring efficient data
processing and seamless interaction between different components. Below is an overview of the system architecture:

### Core Modules and Their Interactions

- **Voice Recognition Module:**
    - Primary entry point for voice input, utilizing OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text conversion.
    - Incorporates Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and buffering for efficient processing.
    - Capable of switching between dictation and command modes based on user input or system settings.

- **Command Processing Module:**
    - Receives and interprets textual data from the Voice Recognition Module.
    - Utilizes a direct matching approach for executing predefined or user-customized commands.
    - Integrates a tagging system to filter and activate commands relevant to the current context or environment.

- **Scripting Interface Module (Command Composer):**
    - Compiles command files into a form that the command processing module will eventually use.
    - Allows users to define custom commands and scripts using C#.
    - Facilitates attribute-based tagging for environment-specific command activation.
    - Provides an interface for users to input and manage custom scripts, which are integrated into the Command
      Processing Module.

- **User Interface (UI) Module:**
    - Serves as the primary interface for user interaction with the system.
    - Hosts the Command Composer for command creation, settings management, help resources, and tutorials.
    - Designed to be intuitive and accessible, catering to a wide range of user preferences and skill levels.

- **Plugin Store:**
    - A web server designed to host the plugins users create, many parts of it are still TBD.
    - It will interact with the UI to load plugins into the system to be then processed by the Scripting Interface.

### Data Flow and Event System

- The system utilizes an event-driven architecture for efficient data flow.
- Audio data captured by the microphone is sent to the Voice Recognition Module through an event system, processed, and
  then relayed to either the Command Processing Module.
- Commands and scripts are executed based on the processed input, with the system dynamically adapting to the current
  environment, user settings, and active tags.

### Integration Points

- The integration between the Command Processing Module and the Scripting Interface ensures that custom user-defined
  commands are processed seamlessly alongside predefined commands.
- The UI Module serves as a central hub for user interaction, linking various system functionalities like command
  creation, system settings, and resource access.
- The system's modular design facilitates easy updates, replacements, or expansions of individual components, enhancing
  the system's adaptability and longevity.

### Privacy Considerations

- The system prioritizes user privacy by processing most data locally.
- When utilizing external APIs (e.g., OpenAI's Whisper), users are responsible for their API usage and adherence to
  privacy policies.
- No personal data is stored or transmitted beyond the user's device, unless explicitly done through user-configured
  APIs.

### Error Handling

- The system is designed to robustly handle errors by logging issues and continuing operation.
- Non-critical errors are logged for diagnostic purposes without interrupting the user experience.
- Critical errors or exceptions, if they arise, are displayed to the user in a non-intrusive manner.
- Exceptions should be strictly evaluated for neccessaity inside event pipe line, as they can incur a high cost on the
  efficiency of the pipe line and should be evaluated also against the trade off of simply losing the event.

### Logging

- System activities and errors are logged to a file, facilitating easy tracking and diagnostics.
- Additional logging sinks (destinations) can be configured as needed.
- Users can access and upload log files for troubleshooting or share them for external support.

### Debugging for User-Made Scripts

- To enhance the development experience of user-made scripts, the system provides a dedicated debugging portal.
- This feature, potentially integrated within the UI module, offers users an intuitive platform for debugging their
  custom scripts.
- Users can access detailed logs and debugging information specific to their scripts, either through the UI or via
  separate log files.
- This functionality aims to streamline the script development process, making it more accessible and efficient for
  users.
