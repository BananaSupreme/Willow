- Need a new way to manage options, at the moment this is kind of ignored. We should look into saving them ourselves
  into Json files that can be read, watched for and edited when needed, microsofts solution makes it really hard to
  manage plugin architecture level configurations.

- **Commands that should be built**
  - switch apps
  - zoom
  - move keys
  - copy, paste, cut
  - tags
  - abbreviating
  - file extensions
  - homophones
  - press keys
  - mode changing
  - repetition and voice command history
  - write formatted
  - write text
  - dictation mode editing
  - move around text
