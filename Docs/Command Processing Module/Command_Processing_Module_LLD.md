## Summary

The Command Processing Module is designed to interpret voice-based commands. This module handles the workflow from
receiving transcribed audio to parsing it into actionable commands. It starts by
tokenizing text into discrete units (tokens) and then parses these tokens against predefined command patterns using a
Trie.
The `Trie` class walks through all of the commands in a DFS manner and checks if the command becomes satisfied at some
point. The core functionality of this module includes identifying and validating voice commands, and upon successful
parsing, it emits a `CommandParsedEvent`.

## Architecture Rationale

### Trie Traversal and Weighing System for Command Matching

- **Decision**: Implementing a Trie structure with a systematic weighing system for command matching.
- **Rationale**:
    - The Trie structure is structured to organize command patterns hierarchically. It allows for efficient searching
      and matching of command phrases, following a specific traversal order.
    - Command specificity in relation to the environment is evaluated at runtime, with nodes tagged and ordered based on
      how well they match the current context. This dynamic assessment enhances the precision of command matching.
    - Processor weights are determined based on the specificity of the tokens they can match. Nodes that match exact
      words or numbers are given higher weights compared to nodes handling wildcards or optional elements. This ensures
      that specific commands are prioritized over more general ones, effectively handling overlapping command patterns.
    - **Rationale for Not Parallelizing Trie Traversal**:
        - The order in which nodes are traversed in the Trie is critical for ensuring the correct interpretation of
          commands, especially in cases where command patterns may overlap or be similar.
        - Parallelizing the traversal could disrupt this carefully established order, potentially leading to incorrect
          or less optimal command matches.
        - The weighing system ensures that the most relevant or likely command is matched first, which is essential for
          the systemâ€™s accuracy and efficiency.
    - **Guidelines for Weighing Decisions**:
        - Weights are assigned based on token specificity: fewer tokens a node can match, the higher its weight should
          be.

### Flexibility with Interfaces for Tokens and Node Processors

- **Decision**: Utilizing interfaces and abstract classes for tokens, node processors and their parsers.
- **Rationale**:
    - This design allows for modular and extendable architecture. New types of tokens and node processors can be added
      seamlessly, catering to evolving requirements.
    - External modules can modify the system's parsing capabilities through Dependency Injection, enhancing adaptability
      without core architecture changes.
    - **Guidelines for Implementing Weights and Syntax**:
        - New command parsers should adhere to the long syntax format (`NodeProcessorType:CapturedVariableName`) for
          consistency, and avoid using symbol notation, as this could be used internally in the core system.

## Components Overview

The Command Processing Module comprises several key components that work together to interpret and parse voice commands:

- **Tokenization**: This process involves breaking down the spoken input into tokens, such as words and numbers.

- **Command Parsing**: Parses the raw command data into `Node` objects that the tokens would be evaluated against.

- **Trie Structure**: Used for efficient parsing of the tokenized input. It organizes command patterns in a hierarchical
  manner.

- **Nodes**: Various types of nodes within the Trie (like WordNode, NumberNode, etc.) represent different segments of a
  command.

- **Command Builder**: Responsible for assembling the parsed data into a structured `Command` object, which encapsulates
  the necessary information for command execution.

## Interface Definitions

### 1. ITokenizer

**Purpose**: Interface for converting raw input strings into a series of tokens.

**Methods**:

- `List<Token> Tokenize(string input)`: Breaks down the input string into tokens.

### 2. ISpecializedTokenProcessor

**Purpose**: Interface for processing a specific type of token.

**Methods**:

- `TokenProcessingResult Process(ReadOnlySpan<char> input)`: Attempts to parse the input string into a token.

### 3. ICommandCompiler

**Purpose**: Interface for compiling preprocessed commands into a sequence of nodes.

**Methods**:

- `NodeProcessor[] Compile(PreProcessedCommand command)`: Converts a `PreProcessedCommand` into a corresponding list of
  node processors.

### 4. ISpecializedCommandProcessor

**Purpose**: Interface for processing a specific type of `NodeProcessor`.

**Methods**:

### 5. ITrieFactory

  CommandBuilder in the end only certain processors can be represented as a leaf node. We should also avoid finalizing
  the command if a more specific command can fit, so leaf nodes are read last.
- `uint Weight`: Defines the weight of the node where lower is higher ranked.

  function and set of commands.
