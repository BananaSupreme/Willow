Some blocking tasks, they are expanded upon in their respective TODOs, this should be done before we're ready to go
public with the project

- Sleep, deep sleep modes, sleep can only receive the wakeup command and deep sleep shuts down microphone
- Whisper mode -- dictation mode powered by whisper that supports its ability to punctuate and uses the prompt...
- Attempt a POC on plugins, create a test case where 2 plugins are loaded and check no exceptions and everything is
  registered correctly
- DOCS! The XML docs part is done, we should add documentations explaining how the system ties together.
  How the speech system works together, how the eventing works, how settings works, a guide to building voice commands.
- UI
- Plugin store, I mean that also means how does the app detect plugins...
