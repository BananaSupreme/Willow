Some blocking tasks, they are expanded upon in their respective TODOs, this should be done before we're ready to go
public with the project

- DOCS! The XML docs part is done, we should add documentations explaining how the system ties together.
  How the speech system works together, how the eventing works, how settings works, a guide to building voice commands.
- UI
- Plugin store, I mean that also means how does the app detect plugins...
