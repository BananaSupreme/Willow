Some blocking tasks, they are expanded upon in their respective TODOs, this should be done before we're ready to go
public with the project

- commands and tags for common use cases (this can be built upon later, but at least the basics)
- homophones comparison when proessing commands
- Vosk speech engine option, it needs a downloader for the model.
- warning when commands that are equivilent are processed
- Basically having UI friendly names for stuff, or a way to get it
- Plugin store
- Nugets, and how do we compose the project, and manage dependencies, i feel like this part will cause us a lot of
  headaches
- UI
- DOCS! when this will go public and look for help people should be able to have a clear idea of the project we are
  looking at some XML docs and explainers on the structure of everything cuz it getting kinda big
