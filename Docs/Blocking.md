Some blocking tasks, they are expanded upon in their respective TODOs, this should be done before we're ready to go
public with the project

- Environment should expose a current platform value and supported platforms enumeration, that way we can trigger only
  voice commands that are relevant for the OS, and speech engines that are relevant
- commands and tags for common use cases (this can be built upon later, but at least the basics)
- homophones comparison when proessing commands
- Vosk speech engine option, it needs a downloader for the model.
- a debug interceptor that can let us here the speech recorder
- make speeche engines easy to switch on and off programatically
- warning when commands that are equivilent are processed
- Getting the name of the commands
- Basically having UI friendly names for stuff, or a way to get it
- Plugin store
- Nugets, and how do we compose the project, and manage dependencies, i feel like this part will cause us a lot of
  headaches
- UI
- DOCS! when this will go public and look for help people should be able to have a clear idea of the project we are
  looking at some XML docs and explainers on the structure of everything cuz it getting kinda big
